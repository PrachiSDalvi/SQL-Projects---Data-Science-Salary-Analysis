# Data Science Salary Analysis Project

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes data science salaries across various job positions, focusing on factors such as **experience level, employment type, company size, and remote work**. Using **SQL queries**, we explore salary trends, disparities, and key patterns that influence compensation in data science roles.

The insights from this project help **data professionals understand salary expectations** and aid **companies in optimizing salary structures**.

## 📊 Key Questions Analyzed
- How many unique job titles exist in the dataset?
- What are the **top 10 highest-paying data science jobs**?
- How does **employment type affect salary** (Full-time, Contract, Part-time)?
- What is the **impact of experience level** on salary trends?
- How have **salaries evolved over the years**?
- What is the **distribution of employees by remote work ratio**?
- How does **company size** influence average salaries?
- What are the **top 3 highest-paying job titles per year**?
- How has **salary growth changed by experience level** over time?
- How do **salary trends look when pivoted by experience level** over the years?
